# Programming Fundamentals Repository

This repository contains all **Programming Fundamentals (PF)** assignments and projects completed as part of my coursework.  
It is intended as a central place to track progress, practice C++ programming concepts, and showcase completed work.

## Contents

- `Assignments/` – Completed PF assignments, including exercises and small programs  
- `Projects/` – Future PF projects assigned by the university (will be added over time)

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Organize all PF-related coursework in one place  
- Track learning and coding progress over time  
- Practice core C++ concepts such as arrays, loops, functions, pointers, and file handling  
- Serve as a reference for future projects and learning

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the `Assignments` or `Projects` folder.  
2. Open the desired `.cpp` file in any C++ compiler (GCC / Visual Studio / CodeBlocks).  
3. Compile and run to test the program.

## Future Plans

- Add all future PF projects assigned by the university  
- Gradually refactor assignments to include object-oriented programming concepts  
- Document each project with a folder-level README for clarity
