# Assignments

This folder contains all assignments completed as part of my Computer Science coursework.  
The assignments cover various topics and exercises to practice programming concepts, problem solving, and logical thinking.

## Contents

Each assignment is organized in its own subfolder or file.  
Examples include:

- `DLD_Assignment1.cpp` – Digital Logic Design exercises  
- `OOP_Assignment1.cpp` – Object-Oriented Programming exercises  
- `C++_Arrays_Assignment.cpp` – Array and pointer exercises  
- Other coursework-related assignments

## Purpose

The goal of this folder is to:

- Track progress and learning through coursework assignments  
- Serve as reference for implemented programming concepts  
- Demonstrate understanding of C++ fundamentals, data structures, and logic design

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the specific assignment file or folder.  
2. Open in any C++ compiler (GCC / Visual Studio / CodeBlocks).  
3. Compile and run to test the code (if applicable).
