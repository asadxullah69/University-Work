# Programming Fundamentals Assignments

This folder contains all **Programming Fundamentals (PF)** assignments completed as part of my coursework.  
These assignments focus on practicing core C++ concepts, problem-solving, and logical thinking.

## Contents

Each file corresponds to a specific PF assignment or exercise.  
Examples include:

- `StudentManagementSystem.cpp` – 2D dynamic arrays, file handling, and menu-driven system  
- Other PF exercises using arrays, loops, and functions

## Purpose

The goal of this folder is to:

- Track progress in Programming Fundamentals  
- Practice C++ syntax, dynamic memory, and basic data structures  
- Build projects and exercises that strengthen coding logic

## How to Use

1. Open the assignment file in any C++ compiler (GCC / Visual Studio / CodeBlocks).  
2. Compile and run the code to test functionality.
