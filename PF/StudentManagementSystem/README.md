# Student Management System (C++)

A console-based Student Management System built in C++ using dynamic memory allocation, 2D dynamic arrays, and file handling.  
This project was created as part of my 2nd semester Computer Science learning to practice low-level data handling and program logic.

## Features
- Add student records
- Store names using 2D dynamic char arrays
- Dynamic resizing of arrays (manual memory management)
- Search student by ID
- Delete last added student
- Save records to file
- Load records from file
- Menu-driven console interface

## Concepts Used
- Dynamic memory allocation (new / delete)
- 1D and 2D dynamic arrays
- Pointers and references
- File handling (fstream)
- Functions and modular code
